# **Comprehensive Property Investment Analysis**

## **Evaluating Feasibility for Optimal Returns**

This project presents a comprehensive analysis framework designed to consistently and systematically assess the feasibility of property investments. This framework aims to provide stakeholders and investors with a standardized approach to evaluating property deals, while facilitating an iterative feedback loop for continuous improvement.

By establishing a standardized framework, this project aims to address the need for a reliable method to evaluate property investments. The implementation of a consistent assessment process empowers stakeholders and investors to make informed decisions, while fostering a dynamic feedback loop that allows for on-going refinement and optimization based on accumulated data and experience.

This projects is a continuation of [insert link to the market analysis study] and aims to build on the foundation created in that project. The goal is to create a comprehensive toolkit for property investors to assist in the process of identifying and analysing investment opportunities. 

Please refer to the full ***Comprehensive Property Investment Analysis Project documentation*** for a detailed description of the process involved with developing this analysis framework. Below an example property is analysed in order to showcase the outcome of the study in terms of being able to analyse a property investment opportunity. 

## **Example Property Analysis**

As defined through the design process, the steps for assessing a potential investment property are as follows:

1. Opportunity identification:  guided by market analysis and investor specific criteria regarding capital availability and so forth
2. Property Data Collection
3. Investment Cost Definition
4. Calculations and Analysis
5. Recommendation

For the purpose of this example a random property currently listed for sale was selected to perform an analysis on. In reality there would be a prerequisite process involving various decisions that need to be made by the individual investor in order to identify the opportunity. This allows negating step 1 and moving straight into property data collection.
